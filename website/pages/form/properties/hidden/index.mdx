## `hidden`

<Split align="end">
  <div>
    The `hidden` property can be used to define hidden values
    for the form.  This is typically used to include identifiers when editing
    existing data records.

    Any `hidden` fields and their values will be included in the
    submitted data.
  </div>
  <TryItOut>
    Submit the form below.  You should see an alert showing that the
    two visible fields and the hidden data were all submitted.
  </TryItOut>
</Split>

<Example
  Component={Hidden}
  code={HiddenSrc}
  caption="hidden" expand
/>
