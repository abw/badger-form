## `UseField`

The immediate <FieldChildrenLink/> of a <FieldLink/> component can
be functions that will receive the field context as the first argument.

<Example
  Component={Children}
  code={ChildrenSrc}
  caption="Field Children"
  expand
/>

However, this only works for the immediate children of the <FieldLink/>.
If you want to include a function that is nested inside another element
(e.g. inside a `div` as shown in this example) then you can
use the `UseForm` component to provide it.

Don't forget that defining any children of a <FieldLink/> component
will override the default <FieldLayoutLink/> component, so you'll need
to add it manually or define your own layout for the field.

<Example
  Component={UFExample}
  code={UFExampleSrc}
  caption="UseField"
  expand
/>
