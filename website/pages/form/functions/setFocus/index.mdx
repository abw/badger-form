## `setFocus()`

<Split align="end">
  <div>
    You can programmatically set the focus on a <FieldLink/> by calling
    the `setFocus()` method on the <FormLink/>, passing the
    name of the field that you want to focus as an argument.

    You can capture a reference to the form using the <FormOnLoadLink/>{' '}
    property to set a state variable, as shown in this example.
  </div>
  <TryItOut>
    Click on one of the buttons to focus on a field.
  </TryItOut>
</Split>

<Example
  Component={FormFocus}
  code={FormFocusSrc}
  caption="onLoad() and setFocus()"
/>

## `useForm`

If the buttons (or other controls) that you want to use to focus
the fields are contained within the <FormLink/> then you can
call the `useForm()` function to gain access to the form
context.

<Example
  Component={UseFormFocus}
  code={UseFormFocusSrc}
  caption="useForm() and setFocus()"
/>

## Preventing Default Event

<Source
  code={FocusButtonSrc}
  expand
>
  Be careful to make sure that your buttons call{' '}
  `e.preventDefault()` on the event, as shown in the example
  above, otherwise the form may be submitted.  Alternately you can pass
  the event to the `setFocus()` method as the second argument
  and it will do it for you, as shown below.
