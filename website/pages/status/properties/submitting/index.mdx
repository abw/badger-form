## `submitting`
<Split>
  The `submitting` property indicates that the child content
  should only be rendered while the form is submitting.
  <TryItOut>
    Try submitting the form.  There's a dummy <FormOnSubmitLink/> function
    defined for the form which will wait for 1 second before returning
    so you can see the form change to the `submitting` state.
  </TryItOut>
</Split>

<Example
  Component={Submitting}
  code={SubmittingSrc}
  caption="submitting"
  expand
/>
