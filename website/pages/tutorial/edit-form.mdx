# Edit Form

<div className="intro">
  Another common use case for forms is in editing existing data records.
</div>

## `values`

<Split>
  You can pass the <FormValuesLink/> property to a <FormLink/> to
  seed it with initial values for fields.  If there are additional
  hidden values that you want to include when you submit the form then
  you can provide them using the <FormHiddenLink/> property.

  <Suggest>
    Try changing some of the values in the form and then
    click on the <b>Reset</b> button.  The fields will
    reset to their original values.
  </Suggest>
</Split>

<Example
  Component={EditForm}
  code={EditFormSrc}
  caption="Edit Form"
/>
