import { Snippet } from '@abw/badger-website'
import { BadgerCSSLink } from '@/site/Links.jsx'

# Getting Started

## Add the Module

Add the `@abw/badger-form` module to your project using your favourite package
manager.

<Snippet
  file="getting-started/add.bash"
  expand
/>

## Import the Components

You can then import the form components and start using them.

<Snippet
  file="getting-started/use.jsx"
  caption="Importing"
  expand
/>

## Import the CSS

Badger Form works out of the box with the form styles provided by
<BadgerCSSLink/>.  If you're already using Badger CSS then you don't need to
do anything else as you should already have something like this in your app.

<Snippet
  file="getting-started/badger-css.jsx"
  caption="Importing Badger CSS"
  expand
/>

If you're not already using Badger CSS then you'll need to import the relevant
CSS styles. As a convenience, they're bundled with this module.  Note that you
only need to import **either** the Badger CSS styles as shown above, **or**
the Badger Form styles as shown below.

The precise details on how you import the CSS will vary depending on what
framework and bundler you're using.  For a React app using Vite or running
under Next.js, for example, you can add the CSS file to your main application
script like so:

<Snippet
  file="getting-started/badger-form-css.jsx"
  caption="Importing Badger Form CSS"
  expand
