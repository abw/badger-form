# Form Validation

<div className="intro">
  Sometimes you need access to all the submitted field values to validate
  the form.  The classic example is a registration form where you ask the
  user to enter their password twice to make sure that they're sure
  about what they've entered.  Although this isn't necessarily
  considered good practice these days, it illustrates the principle well.
</div>

## Registration Form With Validation

<Split>
  <div>
    You can add a <FormValidateLink/> property to a form to provide a
    function to validate the inputs from all fields.  The function will be
    called after the field-level validation, and only if all fields have
    validated successfully.

    The function will be passed a `values` object containing
    the validated field values.  It should return a Promise that resolves
    with the (possibly modified) values if the input is valid, or rejects
    with an an `error` and/or array of `errors` if not.

    The `error` can be used to define an error for the form that
    isn't specific to any particular field.  In this case it's
    being used to raise an error indicating that the two passwords entered
    don't match.

    Each item in the `errors` array should relate to a field identified
    by `name`, with an additional `message`
    indicating why it is invalid.  In this case we're also raising
    errors for both password fields.
  </div>
  <div>
    The <ErrorsLink/> component can used to insert a prominent alert
    anywhere in the form, warning the user about what's
    gone wrong.  By default it will display any generic `error`
    and also a list of any field-specific `errors`.  But here
    we're relying on the fact that the field errors will be displayed
    underneath each field input, so we're setting the
    `fieldErrors` flag to `false` to suppress the
    `errors` list.

    We're also using this opportunity to introduce you to the
    <FieldsLink/> component which allows you to add multiple fields to
    a <FormLink/> in one fell swoop.

    <Suggest>
      Try entering some values in the form below and click on the
      <b>Register</b> button. You should see the field level validation
      errors if you don't provide a valid value for any field. Or if
      you provide different values for the Password and Confirm Password
      fields then you should see the form validation errors.
    </Suggest>
  </div>
</Split>

<Example
  Component={PasswordCheck}
  code={PasswordCheckSrc}
  caption="Form Validation"
  highlightLines="7-22,56"
  expand
/>

<TSNotes>
If you're using Typescript then you can import the `FormValidateFunction` type
for the form validate function.  In the example above we're also importing
the `FieldValue` type for the values passed to the field validation functions.

## Where Next?

Now that we've handled the validation of the form we can talk about how the
form is submitted.
