# Form Submission

<div className="intro">
  To handle submission of a form we need to add an <FormOnSubmitLink/>{' '}
  handler to the <FormLink/> component.
  In most cases this will be
  making a call to a back-end API but to demonstrate the basic principle
  let's start with something simpler.
</div>

## `onSubmit`

<Split align="end">
  We'll create a function which stores the submitted `values` in a state
  variable and displays them on the screen.  The <FormOnSubmitLink/> handler
  is passed an object containing the validated form values.  It should return
  a Promise which resolves on success.  If an error occurs then the Promise
  should reject, returning an object containing either an `error` and/or an
  array of `errors`.  These are handled the same as for
  client-side form validation.

  <Suggest>
    Try entering some values in the form below and click on the
    "Login" button.  You should see the submitted values
    appear in a debugging window beneath the form.
  </Suggest>
</Split>

<Example
  Component={DummySubmit}
  code={DummySubmitSrc}
  caption="Dummy Submission"
/>

## Where Next?

When the form is submitted there are two possible outcomes.  Either
the submission is successful, or there's an error (or errors)
that need to be handled.  We'll look at these in the next few
pages.
