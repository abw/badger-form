# Changed

<div className="intro">
  The `Changed` component is a shortcut implemented as a wrapper around
  the `Status` component for the common case where you only want to display
  part of the form (typically the submit and other buttons) when the form
  has changed.
</div>

<Split>
  <div>
    A simple example is shown below. The "Reset" and "Submit" buttons are only
    displayed once the user has made changes to a form field and the form
    `changed` status flag is true.
  </div>
  <TryItOut>
    Edit one of the fields in the form and you should see the
    "Reset" and "Submit" buttons appear as if by
    magic.  Try clicking on the "Reset" button and they will
    be hidden again.
  </TryItOut>
</Split>

<Example
  Component={Changed}
  code={ChangedSrc}
  caption="Changed"
  expand
/>
