# Submission Errors

<div className="intro">
  For a good user experience we should use client-side validation to
  try and catch all data entry errors *before* they get submitted.
  However, it's not always possible to do that.  It may be the
  case that validating a field requires access to the database and is
  best handled on the server.  Or perhaps a field should be validated
  server-side for security reasons (e.g. validating a Captcha).  Or
  an API request could fail or otherwise be rejected for any number of
  other reasons.  So we must know how to handle these cases.
</div>

## Simple Error

<Split align="end">
  If a submission throws an error or returns an error via a rejected
  Promise then the form submission handler will set the internal
  `error` state variable.
  See the <ErrorsLink/> component for
  more information about changing how and if errors are displayed.

  <Suggest>
    Try submitting this form to see what happens when an error is thrown.
    You should see the error displayed in the form header and also in a
    debugging window beneath the form.
  </Suggest>
</Split>

<Example
  Component={SubmitThrow}
  code={SubmitThrowSrc}
  caption="Error Thrown"
  highlightLines="5"
  expand
/>

As well as calling the `throw()` function with a string, you can `throw` an
`Error` object.

<Example
  Component={SubmitError}
  code={SubmitErrorSrc}
  caption="Error Thrown"
  highlightLines="5"
  expand
/>

## Rejected Promise

<Split align="start">
  <div>
    In most cases a failed submission should return a rejected Promise.
    The data returned should be an objecting containing either a single
    `error` string (or object containing a `message`),
    or an array of `errors`.  Each element in the array can be
    an error string, but the more usual (and useful) case is for each
    element to be an object containing the error `message`.

    The benefit of this approach is that error objects can also contain
    the `name` of the field that it relates to.  The
    corresponding field will be marked as invalid and have the error
    message set so that it can be displayed under the input.  Furthermore,
    the field label is copied into the error element so that it can be
    displayed in the error panel at the start of the form.
  </div>
  <div>
    This would be the typical way to handle a request that failed due to
    server-side validation errors.

    <Suggest title="Try it out">
      Try submitting the form to see the errors generated.
    </Suggest>
  </div>
</Split>

<Example
  Component={SubmitReject}
  code={SubmitRejectSrc}
  caption="Error Thrown"
  highlightLines="4-15"
  expand
/>

## `onError`
<Split>
  You can provide an <FormOnErrorLink/> handler which will be called
  when an error response is received.  In this example we simply call
  a `setError()` function to store the error in a React state
  variable and then display it beneath the form.

  <Suggest>
    Try submitting the form to see the errors generated.  The
    <FormOnErrorLink/> handler will store them in the state variable
    and display them beneath the form.
  </Suggest>
</Split>

<Example
  Component={OnError}
  code={OnErrorSrc}
  caption="onError"
  highlightLines="25"
  expand
/>

<TSNotes>
If you're using Typescript then you can import the `FormSubmitError` type
for the data passed to the `onError` handler.
