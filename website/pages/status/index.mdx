# Status

<div className="intro">
  The `Status` component will only render its child components
  when the form status matches a particular condition.
</div>

<Split>
  <div>
    The component expects one or more properties relating to different
    form status conditions: `changed`, `validating`, `valid`, `invalid`,
    `submitting` and `submitted`. The default behaviour is to only render
    the children when all of the specified conditions are met.

    The `any` property can be provided to change that to match any condition.

    The `not` property can be provided to negate the condition condition.

    A simple example is shown below. The "Reset" and "Submit" buttons are only
    displayed once the user has made changes to a form field and the form
    `changed` status flag is true.
  </div>
  <TryItOut>
    Edit one of the fields in the form and you should see the
    "Reset" and "Submit" buttons appear as if by
    magic.  Try clicking on the "Reset" button and they will
    be hidden again.
  </TryItOut>
</Split>

<Example
  Component={Status}
