# A Basic Form

<div className="intro ">
  One of the underlying principles of this library is that it should be just
  as easy, if not easier, to create a form using Badger Form as it should be
  using vanilla HTML.
</div>

## Login Form

<Split align="start">
  So without further ado, let's look at the one form that most websites will
  require: a user login form.  In this simple example there are fields for the
  user to enter their email address and password.

  <Suggest>
    Try entering some values in the form below and click on the "Login"
    button. Also see what happens if you don't enter a value for either field.
  </Suggest>
</Split>

<Example
  Component={BasicFormCode}
  code={BasicFormSrc}
  caption="Basic Login Form"
  expand
/>

<Split align="start">
  <div>
    ### Form
    The `Form` component can contain any content so you can intersperse form
    fields with other markup.

    The `onSubmit` property should be defined to handle the form submission.
    If you don't define one then a window alert will be shown when the form
    is submitted, as demonstrated in this
    example.
  </div>
  <div>
    ### Field

    The only mandatory property for all `Field` components is `name`.  The
    default `type` is `text` and must be provided if you want any other kind
    of field input type. Some additional properties may be required depending
    on the field type.  For example, a `select` input will also require
    `options` to be defined.

    ### Submit

    A button used to submit the form.  The default text displayed is "Submit"
    which you can change via the `text` property as shown here.
  </div>
