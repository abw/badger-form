## `validate`

<Split align="end">
  <div>
    You can use the <FieldRequiredLink/> property to mark a field as being
    required, but it's a blunt instrument.  All it will do is check that a
    field has some value entered. For more robust validation you can use the
    `validate` property to define an `async` validation function.

    In this example we're using
    <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/yup">Yup</a> but you can
    use anything you like.  It should return the validated value on
    success or throw an error if the valid is invalid.
  </div>
  <TryItOut>
    Try submitting the form without entering any values for either of
    the fields. You should see the custom validation errors.
  </TryItOut>
</Split>

<Example
  Component={Validate}
  code={ValidateSrc}
  caption="validate"
  highlightLines="11-15,21-25"
  expand
/>

<Split align="end">
  <div>
    The `validate` function is passed four arguments.  The first is the field
    value for common cases where that's all you need to determine if the field
    is valid.  The second argument is the field context containing everything
    you need to know about the field state and callable actions to change it.

    The third and fourth arguments are `resolve` and `reject` functions which
    can be called to validate or invalidate the field, respectively.  The
    `resolve` function should be passed an object containing the `value`,
    which may be modified by your function. The `reject` function should be
    passed an object containing an error `message`, and optionally a new
    `value` for the field.
  </div>
  <Suggest>
    In this somewhat contrived example we require the user to enter a username
    containing the word "badger".
  </Suggest>
</Split>

<Example
  Component={Validator}
  code={ValidatorSrc}
  caption="validate"
  highlightLines="6-20"
  expand
/>

<TSNotes>
  The type of a validation function is `FieldValidateFunction`.  The
  `value` argument has a type of `FieldValue`.  The second argument is
  the field context which has a type of `FieldContextItems`.  The third
  are fourth arguments are `resolve` and `reject` functions with type
  `FieldValidateResolve` and `FieldValidateReject`, respectively.
