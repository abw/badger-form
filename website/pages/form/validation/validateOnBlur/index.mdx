import { FieldValidateOnBlurLink } from '@/site/Links.jsx'

## `validateOnBlur`

Fields are usually only validated when the form is submitted.
You can set the <FieldValidateOnBlurLink/> property to `true`
on individual fields, or on the form to set it as the default for all
fields.

When enabled, fields will be validated whenever the input loses focus.
