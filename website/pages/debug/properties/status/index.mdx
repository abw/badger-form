## `status`
<Split>
  You can use the `status` property to view the form status.
  This example includes some dummy handlers to wait 1 second after
  submission before returning a fake response, and then wait 1 second
  after receiving that response to reset the form.
  <TryItOut>
    Try entering a message and then submit the form.  See how the
    form status changes when the form is submitted and after a response
    is received.  Also try NOT entering a message to see the invalid
    state.
  </TryItOut>
</Split>

<Example
  Component={Status}
  code={StatusSrc}
  caption="status"
  expand
/>
