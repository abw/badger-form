## `optional`

You can add an `optional` property to a field to explicitly mark it as being
optional.  In many cases this won't have any effect as a field is assumed to
be optional if it isn's explicitly marked as being <FieldRequiredLink/>.

However, if a <FieldValidateLink/> function is defined for a field then it
will always be run, even if the field value is empty. If you only want the
<FieldValidateLink/> function to be run if a value has been entered then you
can add the `optional` property to the field.  In this case an empty value
will be accepted and the <FieldValidateLink/> function will only be run if
the user has entered something in the field

In this example there is a <FieldValidateLink/> function which asserts that
the value entered is at least 3 characters long.  The first field behaves as
usual - you must enter a value and it must pass the validation function.  The
second field has the `optional` property set. In this case an empty value is
acceptable, but if you do enter a value then it must pass validation.
