## `children`

You can define children of a field, either as components or functions.
Components can access the field context via `useField`.
Functions receive the field context as the first argument.

Note that if you define children for the field then it will
replace the default <FieldLayoutLink/> component.  In this case it&apos;s
up to you to render the field content.

If you want to include the default layout for a field and add
some content of your own then you can include the <FieldLayoutLink/> component
manually.

<Example
  Component={Functions}
  code={FunctionsSrc}
  caption="children"
  expand
/>
