## `not`
<Split>
  <div>
    The `not` property indicates that the child content
    should only be rendered when the specified conditions are not true.
    It can be combined with the `any` property if necessary.

    The example below includes the <DebugLink/> component so that you
    can see the form status changing.
  </div>
  <TryItOut>
    The Reset and Submit buttons will only be displayed when the form
    as been changed.  An info alert is displayed when in their place
    when the form has <b>not</b> been changed.
  </TryItOut>
</Split>

<Example
  Component={Not}
  code={NotSrc}
  caption="not"
  undent={2}
  expand
/>
