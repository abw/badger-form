## `debug`

<Split>
  The `debug` property is your friend when it's 5pm on a
  Friday and you promised your boss/client that you would get the form
  changes made before you went home, but you can't figure out why
  it's not working.
  <TryItOut>
    Open up the Javascript console and watch the pretty messages go
    flying by!
  </TryItOut>
</Split>

<Example
  Component={Debug}
  code={DebugSrc}
  caption="debug"
  highlightLines="4"
  expand
/>
<SeeAlso
  links={[
    DebugLink
  ]}
/>
