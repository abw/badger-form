## `fields`

The `fields` property allows you to define properties
for form fields externally.  The <FieldLink/> <FieldNameLink/> property
is used to associate a field to its definition.

<Example
  Component={Fields}
  code={FieldsSrc}
  caption="fields"
/>

This is the same as defining the properties on the <FieldLink/> components.

<Example
  Component={Inline}
  code={InlineSrc}
  caption="fields"
/>

The `fields` definition can contain any number of fields,
including those that aren't used by any particular form.  Only
the fields that are referenced by a <FieldLink/> component will be
considered part of the form.

Although it requires a little more work to define fields externally, there
are a number of benefits.  The first is that you're separating the
field definition from the presentational markup.  When a form gets
more complex it's usually easier to have them separated,
particularly if you have more complicated validation functions attached
to the fields.

Another benefit is that you can share field definitions
across multiple forms.  For example, you might want to define a single
set of field definitions for all forms relating to user authentication:
login, registration, password reset, and so on.  The `email`{' '}
field will be the same for each, so it makes sense to define it in one
place.
