## `inline`

The default behaviour is to make the text fields extend to the
full width of the container.  Bitter experience has taught me that
it's generally easier to do this and constrain the width of
the container than it is to try and get all inputs the same width,
especially if you're using prefix and suffix elements.

You can set the `inline` property on a field if you want
the input to have fluid width.  The <TextInputSizeLink/> can be used
to set the input size.

<Example
  Component={Inline}
  code={InlineSrc}
  caption="inline"
  undent={2}
  expand
/>
