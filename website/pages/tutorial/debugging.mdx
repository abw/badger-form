# Debugging

<div className="intro">
  Let't face it, things don't always work right first time,
  so being able to debug your forms is an important requirement.
</div>

## `Debug` Component and `debug` Property

<Split align="end">
  <div>
    The <DebugLink/> component can be added to a form to display information
    about the form values and other state variables.  By default it shows
    only the form values, but you can use the `status` option to
    also show the form status.  If for some reason you don't want to
    see the values you can set `values` to `false`.

    If you add the <FormDebugLink/> property to a <FormLink/> or{' '}
    <FieldLink/> then it will enable debugging messages for that component.
    These will be output to the Javascript console.  Any properties (like{' '}
    `debug`) that are passed to the <FieldsLink/> component will
    be forwarded onto the respective <FieldLink/> components, so it works
    there too.
  </div>
  <Suggest>
    Try changing some of the values in the form.  Watch the form values
    and status change in the debugging panel.  Also check out the
    Javascript console for further debugging messages.
  </Suggest>
</Split>

<Example
  Component={Debugging}
